# Hangman Game
This is a "HangMan" c# course project game, created by Ivailo Kirilov (Our team leader), Georgi Georgiev (Our code writer), Deo Georgiev (Presentator), Kostadin Maistorov (Tester) and Sava Arabov (Documentary). Every role is chosen by our teacher Ivan Ivanov and below you will find everything that can answer your questions.
## HangMan Rules  

The game is simple. You will have a number of attempts depending on the difficulty you choose. The program will randomly select a word that you need to guess by suggesting letters that you think are in the word. Each mistake reduces your remaining attempts. When you run out of attempts, you lose, and the game will restart if you choose to play again.
