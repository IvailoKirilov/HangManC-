# Hangman Game
This is a "HangMan" c# course project game, created by @IvailoKirilov (Our team leader), @GeorgiGeorgiev (Our code writer), @DeyanGeorgiev223 (Presentator), @USAAAAAAA (Tester) and @SavaArabov (Documentary). Every role is chosen by our teacher Ivan Ivanov and below you will find everything that can answer your questions.
## HangMan Rules  

The game is simple. You will have a number of attempts depending on the difficulty you choose. The program will randomly select a word that you need to guess by suggesting letters that you think are in the word. Each mistake reduces your remaining attempts. When you run out of attempts, you lose, and the game will restart if you choose to play again.
